# GraphColoringGame
This is a web game created to serve as a learning tool. It illustrates the greedy algorithm in an undirected graph
in the form of a coloring game. The rule is you must color the entire graph using the least amount of colors and neighboring
nodes are not allowed to be the same color. A node is neighbors with another node if they are connected by an edge.
